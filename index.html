        <h4>The Sanctuary</h4>
        <p>
          The Sanctuary is inside the memorial and is the Shrineâ€™s most
          important space. Each year, thousands attend commemorative ceremonies
          to remember the sacrifices of Australian service men and women. The
          Stone of Remembrance is in the centre of the Sanctuary. It is symbolic
          of a gravestone for those Victorian servicemen and women buried
          overseas and in unmarked graves.
        </p>
        <h4>The Galleries of Remembrance</h4>
        <p>
          The Galleries present the stories of Australians in wartime for more
          than 100 years. Visitors follow this experience presented in more than
          800 artworks and historical objects, interactive multimedia, rare
          images and films. The Galleries are a cathedral-like space located
          inside the monument, below the Sanctuary. We recommend at least 1.5
          hours to explore them fully.
        </p>
        <h4>The Crypt</h4>
        <p>
          The Crypt lies directly beneath the Stone of Remembrance. It
          commemorates the fighting units of the First World War. Around the
          walls of the Crypt, the unit colour patches and the names of ships
          lost in war are preserved in bronze.
